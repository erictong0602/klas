# Kafka Log Aggregation System (KLAS)

**Kafka Log Aggregation System (KLAS)** is an experimental setup designed to aggregate, process, and manage application logs using Apache Kafka. This experiment leverages Kafkaâ€™s high-throughput and low-latency messaging capabilities to handle large volumes of log messages efficiently, providing a scalable and resilient log management solution.

## Components

- **Kafka Controllers and Brokers**: A set of Kafka controllers and brokers configured to manage and distribute log messages. The controllers ensure high availability and fault tolerance while the brokers handle the actual message storage and distribution.

- **Prometheus**: Monitors the health and performance of Kafka components and other services, providing real-time metrics and alerts.

- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus, enabling insightful dashboards and monitoring of the Kafka ecosystem.

- **Logstash**: Ingests, processes, and forwards log data from Kafka to Elasticsearch, facilitating complex transformations and filtering of log messages.

- **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes log data, providing powerful search and analytics capabilities.

- **Kibana**: Offers a web interface for visualizing and analyzing log data stored in Elasticsearch, allowing users to create dashboards and perform advanced searches.

## Overview

This setup enables robust log aggregation, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive analysis, enhancing the observability and management of log data in diverse application environments.
